~ Re-added missing scripts
~ Minor tweaks to code efficiency
~ Prepared environment to accept necessary files (no changes to images yet)
~ Code accepts a FITS table with RA/Dec of each corner of the aperture, followed by the source ID and then the aperture angle
~ Branched main code into two different routes at execution time by adding a flag-check for whether aperture coordinates have been provided
~ Subdivided most of the original main function into smaller sub-functions so the main function is dedicated to handling the different input cases
~ Restored a temporary (incorrect) alignment file for datasets where apertures are already provided. Needs an urgent feature branch for implementing whether or not to re-align images based on presence of target acquisition.
~ Temporarily commented out source RA, Dec for apertures given. Will need to be implemented in a later commit.
~ Some galaxies have non-integer IDs (bad shutters), so have temporarily limited range of loop while testing.
~ Added source, alignment and working directories as variables, so this can be customised by the user.
~ Added image file preview, so user can decide which extensions to include. Unfortunately, no way to make this truly dynamic yet.
~ Added alignment flag for when user does not provide alignment stars
~ Added exception for when user does not list any custom ID annuli, so the code runs without error
~ Added third errflag option (None) which disables photometry error estimate. This should save time on very large images.
