- (MOSTLY DONE) Implement MEDIUM images with dynamic extensions, so can accurately test results
	- Need to make sure photometry calculation isn't affected
- Make alignment stars optional
- Include source RA, Dec for aperture provided
- Adjust fits file to remove bad shutters
- Add demo folder with relevant SMACS files, since the MEDIUM file are way too big and slow down the calculations a lot
