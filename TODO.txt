- (medium) Include source RA, Dec for the apertures-provided case
- (medium) Adjust input fits file to remove bad shutters
- (medium) Clean up unnecessary calculations (e.g. defining the physical aperture). Will require major rewrite.
- (low) Add demo folder with relevant SMACS files, since the MEDIUM file areway too big and slow down the calculations a lot
- (DONE) If input apertures are illuminated, add flag for illuminated case which bypasses geometry calculations.
- (DONE) Implement recalculation of angle from aperture corners, as this differs slightly from planned angle.
- (DONE) Clean up test-results from notebook.
- (DONE) Implement MEDIUM images with dynamic extensions, so can accurately test results
	- Need to make sure photometry calculation isn't affected
- (DONE) Make alignment stars optional
- (DONE) Need to optimise the matrix calculations so that large images are efficient
	- Used a postage stamp cutout centred around the source, reduces computation time by 10x.
	- But watch-out! Postage stamp needs to be centred directly on the pixel centre, or it will interpolate, which messes up your calculations. So needed to calculate the new coordinates with respect to the math.floored cutout box.
