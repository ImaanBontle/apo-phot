- Added ability to differentiate between physical and illuminated input apertures. If illuminated, the aperture will not be recalculated and instead code proceeds directly to the photometry. ApFlag updated appropriately (False: no apertures provided, "Physical": physical apertures provided, "Illuminated": illuminated apertures provided).
- Implemented manual aperture angle calculation if the apertures are provided; more accurate than using planned angles.
