~ Removed masked array from image arrays, as this slows down computation and is not needed except for image statistics. Images should implement this separately if still needed
~ Implemented cutout postage stamps to speed up photometry calculations
~ Switched background flux calculation to a flux per square pixel rather than a mean, so that the calculation is performed with exact pixel accuracy (otherwise photutils uses pixel centres)
~ Renamed AlignFlag values to make more intuitive sense
