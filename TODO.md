# To-Do List

## High Priority

- [ ] Add error propagation to the filter throughputs
- [ ] Fix issue with units/magnitudes in filter throughputs
- [ ] Adapt filter throughputs to the new output format
- [ ] Implement generalised EW calculations
- [ ] Allow EW calcs to account for multiple lines
- [ ] Calculate average geometric slit offset corrections

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Trial Peter's geometric datacube and other suggestions
- [ ] Update README for new output format
- [ ] Clean up unnecessary calculations (e.g. defining the physical aperture). Will require major rewrite.

## Low Priority

- [ ] Add demo folder with relevant SMACS files, since the MEDIUM files are way too big and slow down the calculations a lot.
