# To-Do List

## High Priority

None.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Clean up unnecessary calculations (e.g. defining the physical aperture). Will require major rewrite.

## Low Priority

- [ ] Add demo folder with relevant SMACS files, since the MEDIUM files are way too big and slow down the calculations a lot.
