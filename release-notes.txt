Code significantly revised to prevent memory leaks when using massive images (10s of GBs). Now all images and catalogues are loaded internally and only their names and directories are specified beforehand. Additionally, the aperture-area is now included in the output and photometry column names have been tweaked to be more intuitive to the user.

## What's Changed

- Catalogues with aperture corners are expected to have an additional column for visit name/number.
- Aperture areas added to output.
- Data import moved to inside codeblock to avoid memory leaks. Initial section repurposed into user-defined variables and lists to accommodate the change.
- Internal variable naming scheme tweaked to bring consistency between branching paths. Longlist dictionary has been depreciated in favour of a consistent "Catalogue", "AlignCat" and "ImageDict" naming convention.
- Output column names tweaked to be more intuitive.
