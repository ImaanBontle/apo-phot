v0.3.1
-----
- Cleaned repository, added separate utilities, scripts, and logs folders.
- Added utility notebook 'Prep_Apertures.ipynb' which prepares aperture corners for apodised photometry.
- Re-implemented source co-ordinates in the apertures-provided case. Annuli are now centred on the source again.

v0.3.0
-----
- Added aperture corners to output in all cases, for easier cross-referencing with input catalogues.
- Added auto-overwrite for calculations, to save time. May add flag later.- Added ability to differentiate between physical and illuminated input apertures. If illuminated, the aperture will not be recalculated and instead code proceeds directly to the photometry. ApFlag updated appropriately (False: no apertures provided, "Physical": physical apertures provided, "Illuminated": illuminated apertures provided).
- Implemented manual aperture angle calculation if the apertures are provided; more accurate than using planned angles.

v0.2.0
-----
- Re-added missing scripts
- Minor tweaks to code efficiency
- Prepared environment to accept necessary files (no changes to images yet)
- Code accepts a FITS table with RA/Dec of each corner of the aperture, followed by the source ID and then the aperture angle
- Branched main code into two different routes at execution time by adding a flag-check for whether aperture coordinates have been provided
- Subdivided most of the original main function into smaller sub-functions so the main function is dedicated to handling the different input cases
- Restored a temporary (incorrect) alignment file for datasets where apertures are already provided. Needs an urgent feature branch for implementing whether or not to re-align images based on presence of target acquisition.
- Temporarily commented out source RA, Dec for apertures given. Will need to be implemented in a later commit.
- Some galaxies have non-integer IDs (bad shutters), so have temporarily limited range of loop while testing.
- Added source, alignment and working directories as variables, so this can be customised by the user.
- Added image file preview, so user can decide which extensions to include. Unfortunately, no way to make this truly dynamic yet.
- Added alignment flag for when user does not provide alignment stars
- Added exception for when user does not list any custom ID annuli, so the code runs without error
- Added third errflag option (None) which disables photometry error estimate. This should save time on very large images.
- Removed masked array from image arrays, as this slows down computation and is not needed except for image statistics. Images should implement this separately if still needed
- Implemented cutout postage stamps to speed up photometry calculations
- Switched background flux calculation to a flux per square pixel rather than a mean, so that the calculation is performed with exact pixel accuracy (otherwise photutils uses pixel centres)
- Renamed AlignFlag values to make more intuitive sense

v0.1.2:
-----
- Annulus sizes now adjust dynamically to the image's pixel scale, with the first image's pixel scale used as reference.
- Added script to update changelog with latest changes.
- Updated README.

v0.1.1:
-----
- Added correct annulus sizes for each image based on differing pixel scales.

v0.1:
-----
- Added edited description from repository readme to notebook.
- Removed Gaia section.
