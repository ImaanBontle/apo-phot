v0.4.0
-----
- Catalogue visit loop now depends on length of visit list, so that you can run singular/multiple visit catalogues without problem
- Added aperture area to visit output
- New utility notebook for exploring slit-loss correction files
- Moved data import inside main codeblock and repurposed initial section into user-defined variable names & lists. This prevents memory leaks due to large image files being loaded into RAM prior to code execution. Now, they are loaded once during execution, manipulated, and then overwritten in the next loop, so that only one image is ever in circulation. Finally, when the code ends, all internal variables are cleared from RAM as a byproduct of how python handles local variables contained inside functions, ensuring that the final image is also cleared from memory. Altogether should make massive images (tens of GBs) more feasible on local machines.
- Rearranged internal code to accommodate the above change, renaming several objects to be more intuitive i.e. disposed of confusing "Longlist" dictionary in favour of homogenised "Catalogue", "AlignCat" and "ImageDict" objects. Opens door to reducing size of branching paths in future so that code is more readable.
